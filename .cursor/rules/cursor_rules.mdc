# Manual QA Framework - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
**Title**: Manual QA Framework  
**Purpose**: Internal company framework for standardized manual QA processes  
**Status**: Active Development  

## Framework Overview
- **Manual QA Framework**: Comprehensive testing framework for internal company use
- **JIRA Integration**: Full integration with company JIRA for bug tracking and test management
- **Standardized Processes**: Consistent bug reporting, test planning, and documentation
- **Project-Specific Testing**: Dedicated testing for specific projects like OES (Ownership Entity System)
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Both PowerShell (Windows) and Bash (Mac/Linux) implementations

## Task Management
- **Current Tasks**: See `task_tracking.mdc` for current tasks and project status
- **Task Updates**: Update `task_tracking.mdc` for task changes, not this file

## Key Components
- **01-jira-integration**: JIRA API integration and field configurations
- **02-bug-reports**: Standardized bug report templates and examples
- **03-test-plans**: Test plan templates and examples
- **04-projects**: Project-specific testing documentation and rules
- **05-utilities**: Helper tools and traceability matrices
- **06-documentation**: Framework guides and standards

## CRITICAL RULES - NEVER FORGET
- **NEVER DELETE EXISTING DOCUMENTATION**: Always preserve all existing content
- **ALWAYS ADD NEW INFORMATION ON TOP**: Place new sections, fields, or information at the beginning of documents
- **PRESERVE COMPLETE HISTORY**: Maintain all existing examples, references, and detailed information
- **APPEND, DON'T REPLACE**: When updating documentation, add new sections rather than replacing existing ones
- **MAINTAIN BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY**: Keep all existing field references, examples, and formats
- **FOCUS ON ADDING, NOT REMOVING**: Mostly focus on adding content, not taking away existing information
- **ONLY REMOVE IF DUPLICATED/OUTDATED**: Only remove content if it's clearly duplicated or outdated, otherwise preserve it
- **CRITICAL**: CURSOR SHOULD NOT GENERATE ANY NEW FILES IF NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
- **ALWAYS READ EXISTING DOCUMENTATION FIRST** before creating anything new
- **Check existing files** for similar functionality before creating duplicates
- **Update existing files** instead of creating new ones when possible
- **Only create new files** when there's a clear, unique need that cannot be addressed by updating existing files

## PROJECT FOLDER RULES - ENFORCE STRICTLY
- **ONLY DOCUMENTATION FOLDER CAN BE PUSHED**: In project folders (04-projects/*), only the documentation folder can be committed to git
- **ALL OTHER PROJECT FILES ARE GITIGNORED**: Test files, bug reports, test results, screenshots, etc. are excluded from version control
- **DOCUMENTATION FOLDER RESTRICTIONS**: Documentation folder can ONLY contain project documentation, NOT testing files
- **FINAL TESTING SUMMARY**: When testing is complete, create ONE .md file with aggregated data (bugs, test cases, test results)
- **NO INDIVIDUAL TESTING FILES**: Individual bug reports, test cases, or test results should NOT be in documentation folder
- **PROJECT DOCUMENTATION ONLY**: Documentation folder should contain project rules, requirements, specifications, and final summary

- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation under 04-projects/ownership-entity/
- ✅ Reorganized project structure for better scalability
- ✅ Updated framework documentation to reflect new structure

## Framework Organization
- ✅ Refactored all "Testing Cup" references to "Manual QA Framework"
- ✅ Updated framework structure for better organization
- ✅ Moved OES documentation to 04-projects/ownership-entity/

## JIRA Field Discovery
- ✅ Retrieved all JIRA fields via API
- ✅ Identified QA Assignee fields: customfield_11207 (single), customfield_11313/11308 (multi)
- ✅ Found standard user fields: assignee, reporter, creator
- ✅ Discovered additional assignee fields: Data Assignee, Research Assignee
- ✅ Added new field information while preserving existing documentation

## Show My Tickets Command - Cross-Platform Testing
- ✅ Successfully executed PowerShell version (show_my_tickets.ps1)
- ✅ Found 26 tickets assigned to user as QA Assignee (customfield_11207)
- ✅ Fixed PowerShell syntax issues (ampersand escaping, special characters)

- ✅ Successfully tested shell script version (show_my_tickets.sh)
- ✅ Confirmed API connectivity and authentication working
- ✅ Fixed JQL encoding issues in shell script
- ✅ Identified platform-specific differences in query results
- ✅ Both scripts now functional with proper error handling

## Cross-Platform Compatibility Findings
- **PowerShell (.ps1)**: Works perfectly on Windows, finds 26 QA Assignee tickets
- **Bash (.sh)**: Works on Mac/Linux, API connectivity confirmed, but JQL query differences
- **Authentication**: Both scripts successfully authenticate with JIRA API
- **Error Handling**: Both scripts handle errors gracefully
- **Table Formatting**: Simplified formatting for better cross-platform compatibility
- **Special Characters**: Removed problematic Unicode characters for better compatibility

- ✅ Updated README.md with command documentation



## Cross-Platform JIRA Commands - COMPLETED
- ✅ Fixed Bash script authentication issues (was using wrong auth method)
- ✅ Both PowerShell and Bash versions working perfectly
- ✅ Technical detection working on both platforms
- ✅ User authentication and JIRA API calls working correctly
- ✅ Cross-platform ticket creation and commenting fully functional

## BUG CREATION RULES - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE
**CRITICAL**: EVERY bug ticket MUST be validated against bug_metrics_reference.md BEFORE publishing.

### PRE-PUBLISHING VALIDATION CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)
BEFORE creating ANY ticket, verify compliance with bug_metrics_reference.md:

1. **Pre-Reporting Quality Checklist**:
   - ✅ Bug reproduced 2-3 times
   - ✅ Checked Tech bug board for duplicates using keywords  
   - ✅ Verified if same issue exists in related modules
   - ✅ Written detailed reproduction steps
   - ✅ Attached videos, screenshots, logs
   - ✅ All mandatory fields completed

2. **Summary Format**: "[QA Manual Framework Testing] [Feature/Functionality Name] Title"

3. **Mandatory JIRA Fields**:
   - Project: "All Tech Projects (AP)"
   - Issue Type: "Bug (t)" (ID: 1)
   - Environment: Highest affected (dev → stage → prod)
   - User: Credentials with Vault link

4. **Required Sections** (ALL MANDATORY):
   - Description
   - Preconditions (setup requirements, user access, data state)
   - Steps to Reproduce (start with "Login as [user type] for example")
   - Expected Result (specific outcomes)
   - Actual Result (what actually happens)
   - Additional Information (environment, browser, errors, related tickets)

5. **Visual Proof Requirements**:
   - Screenshots with page URL visible
   - Developer console open with JavaScript errors
   - System information (OS version, browser version)
   - Videos/logs when applicable

6. **Severity Classification**: Use P0/P1/P2/P3/P4/5MF (NOT "Major/Minor")
   - P0: Site Outage
   - P1: Trust/Data Issues & Data Feed/API issues
   - P2: Broken Functionality With No Work Around
   - P3: Broken Functionality With Work Around
   - P4: Usability Concerns
   - 5MF: Five Minute Fix

### TECHNICAL BUG REPORTS - ENHANCED REQUIREMENTS
When user provides detailed technical information:
- Include all standard sections PLUS technical evidence
- Add ES document structures, API responses in code blocks
- Include environment comparison analysis
- Add root cause analysis section
- Use proper ADF formatting with headings and structured content

### VALIDATION PROCESS
1. Generate ticket content
2. CHECK against bug_metrics_reference.md compliance
3. Identify missing sections
4. ADD missing mandatory sections
5. VERIFY all checklist items
6. Only THEN publish ticket

**CRITICAL**: NO ticket should be published without full bug_metrics_reference.md compliance verification.

## Next Steps
1. Complete bug documentation alignment with company standards
2. Continue developing additional JIRA commands (show-ticket, update-status, add-comment)
3. Implement bug report generation commands
4. Add test plan generation functionality
5. Continue with framework development as needed
