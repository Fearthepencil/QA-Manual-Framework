- **04-projects**: Project-specific testing documentation and rules
- **05-utilities**: Helper tools and traceability matrices
- **06-documentation**: Framework guides and standards

## CRITICAL RULES - NEVER FORGET
- **NEVER DELETE EXISTING DOCUMENTATION**: Always preserve all existing content
- **ALWAYS ADD NEW INFORMATION ON TOP**: Place new sections, fields, or information at the beginning of documents
