[READY] [PRODUCT CATALOG] All Books/All CDs button does not display full product list

---

### Description

When navigating to the Books or CDs category pages and clicking the "All Books" or "All CDs" button, the system fails to display the complete list of products. The button appears to be non-functional as no action occurs when clicked, preventing users from viewing all available books or CDs in the respective categories.

---

### Expected Behaviour

- Clicking "All Books" button should display a complete list of all available books
- Clicking "All CDs" button should display a complete list of all available CDs
- The button should be clearly interactive and responsive to user clicks
- Product listings should show book/CD summaries with required properties (author/artist, title, publisher/label, price)
- Navigation should work smoothly without page errors or blank content

---

### Actual Behaviour

- Clicking "All Books" button produces no visible response or action
- Clicking "All CDs" button produces no visible response or action
- No product list is displayed after clicking the buttons
- The page remains in the same state as before clicking
- No error messages or feedback are provided to the user
- The buttons appear to be non-functional or broken
