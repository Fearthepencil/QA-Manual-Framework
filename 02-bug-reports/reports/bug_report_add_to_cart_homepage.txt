Bug Report: Add to Cart Functionality Fails on Homepage Featured Books

Title
User unable to add featured books to cart from homepage - Add to Cart button non-functional

Description
When a user is on the homepage and attempts to add a featured book to the shopping cart by clicking on the featured book and then clicking the "Add to Cart" button, the book is not added to the cart. This is a critical functionality failure that prevents users from making purchases directly from the homepage, significantly impacting the user experience and potential sales conversion. The issue appears to be related to JavaScript functionality, event handling, or cart state management for featured products on the homepage.

Expected Behaviour
- User should be able to click on a featured book on the homepage
- "Add to Cart" button should be clickable and functional
- Book should be successfully added to the shopping cart
- Cart should update to reflect the added item
- User should receive visual feedback (cart icon update, confirmation message, etc.)
- Cart count should increment by 1

Actual Behaviour
- User can click on featured book on the homepage
- "Add to Cart" button appears to be clickable
- No visual feedback when button is clicked
- Book is not added to the shopping cart
- Cart count does not increment
- No error message is displayed to the user
- User is left with no indication that the action failed
