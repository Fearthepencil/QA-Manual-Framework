**Epic**: [AP-20446](https://compstak.atlassian.net/browse/AP-20446)  
**Team**: Helios  
**Created**: 2025-01-27

## Testing Requirements

### Core Features to Test
1. **Folder Creation** (AP-20465)
   - Create new folder from dropdown
   - Validate folder name requirements
   - Test duplicate folder names

2. **Folder Management** (AP-20453, AP-20452)
   - Rename existing folders
   - Delete folders (with confirmation)
   - Handle folders with existing comps

3. **Comp Management** (AP-20450, AP-20449, AP-20447)
   - Add comps from list view
   - Add comps from lease detail view
   - Remove comps from folders
   - View folder contents

### Environment Testing
- **Dev**: Development testing
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Live environment testing

### Test Data Requirements
- User accounts with various permission levels
- Sample lease comps for testing
- Test folders with various configurations
- Edge case data (empty folders, large numbers of comps)

### Quality Standards
- All 6 core features must pass functional testing
- UI/UX must match Figma design specifications
- No critical or high-severity bugs allowed
- Performance benchmarks must be met

### Risk Areas
- Folder permission management complexity
- Performance with large numbers of comps
- Data consistency during concurrent operations

### Documentation Links
- **Requirements**: [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rtKQ9IMbidst8gMamR0R91dodmFj28OSsEgC7vHXwDQ/edit?tab=t.0)
