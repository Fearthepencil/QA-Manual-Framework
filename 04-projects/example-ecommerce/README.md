# üõí E-Commerce Platform Testing - Example Project

This is an example project demonstrating how to use the Manual QA Framework for testing an e-commerce platform. This example shows real-world testing scenarios without any proprietary business information.

## üìã Project Information

**Project Name**: E-Commerce Platform  
**Project Type**: Web Application  
**Testing Phase**: Functional Testing  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27

## üéØ Project Overview

### **Business Context**
An e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, add items to cart, and complete purchases. The platform includes user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout process, and order management.

### **Testing Objectives**
- Ensure all core e-commerce functionality works correctly
- Validate user experience across different devices and browsers
- Verify payment processing and security measures
- Test performance under various load conditions

### **Scope**
- **In Scope**: User registration, product browsing, cart management, checkout, order processing
- **Out of Scope**: Third-party payment gateway integration details, inventory management backend
- **Testing Boundaries**: Focus on customer-facing functionality and user workflows

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### **Testing Approach**
- Risk-based testing focusing on critical user journeys
- Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility testing
- Performance testing for peak shopping periods
- Security testing for payment and user data

### **Test Types**
- **Functional Testing**: Core e-commerce workflows
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Performance, security, usability
- **Integration Testing**: Payment gateway, inventory system
- **User Acceptance Testing**: End-to-end customer journeys

### **Environments**
- **Development**: Feature testing and bug fixes
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Live environment monitoring

## üìä Test Planning

### **Test Cases**

#### **User Authentication**
- User registration with valid/invalid data
- User login with correct/incorrect credentials
- Password reset functionality
- Account lockout after failed attempts

#### **Product Catalog**
- Product search and filtering
- Product category navigation
- Product detail page display
- Product image gallery and zoom

#### **Shopping Cart**
- Add products to cart
- Update product quantities
- Remove products from cart
- Cart persistence across sessions

#### **Checkout Process**
- Address entry and validation
- Payment method selection
- Order confirmation
- Email notifications

### **Test Data Requirements**
- Test user accounts with various permission levels
- Sample products with different categories and prices
- Test payment methods (credit cards, PayPal)
- Various shipping addresses and tax scenarios

## üêõ Bug Management

### **Bug Reporting Standards**
All bugs must follow the framework's bug reporting standards:
- Use proper summary format: `[E-Commerce] [Feature] Issue Description`
- Include all mandatory sections: Description, Preconditions, Steps, Expected/Actual Results
- Attach screenshots with page URLs and developer console
- Classify severity using P0-P4 scale

### **Critical Areas for Bug Detection**
- Payment processing failures
- User data security issues
- Cart data corruption
- Order processing errors
- Performance degradation

## üîß Framework Integration

### **JIRA Configuration**
- **Project**: E-COMMERCE
- **Issue Type**: Bug
- **Custom Fields**: 
  - Environment: Dev/Staging/Production
  - Browser: Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge
  - Device: Desktop/Tablet/Mobile
  - Payment Method: Credit Card/PayPal

### **Test Automation**
- Selenium WebDriver for UI testing
- API testing with Postman/Newman
- Performance testing with JMeter
- Security testing with OWASP ZAP

## üìà Quality Metrics

### **Test Coverage Goals**
- **Functional Coverage**: 95% of user workflows
- **Browser Coverage**: 100% of supported browsers
- **Device Coverage**: 100% of supported devices
- **Performance Coverage**: Load testing for 2x peak traffic

### **Defect Metrics Targets**
- **Critical Bugs**: 0 in production
- **High Priority Bugs**: <5 in production
- **Bug Resolution Time**: <24 hours for critical, <72 hours for high

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **1. Setup Testing Environment**
```bash
# Copy the project template
cp -r 04-projects/template ecommerce-testing
cd ecommerce-testing

# Customize for e-commerce project
# - Update project information
# - Configure JIRA fields
# - Set up test data
```

### **2. Execute Test Plan**
